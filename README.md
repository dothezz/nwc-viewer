# nwc-viewer
NoteworthyComposer file viewer and rendering in js and html

Had the idea to port nwc2ly to js...

## Experimental Works in Progress.

This project contains
- a binary file reader / parser
- nwc file decoder
- vexflow rendering

The NWC file format was based on the almost 10 year old work I've done on [nwc2ly.py](https://github.com/zz85/nwc2ly.py).
